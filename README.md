**Overview:**
In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

To frame the task, throughout these practical applications, we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM Links to an external site.

**Objectives:**

Analyzing the data and figuring out what features drive the price of the cars and then predict car pricing.

**Deliverable Report**

If you're in the business of selling used cars, this guide is for you. We looked at a bunch of car sales and figured out what makes some cars sell for more money. Here's the scoop:

The two most important features driving the prices of the car are the year and odometer reading.

**Newer is Better** 
**People Like Newer Cars**. Cars that aren't very old usually sell for more money. 
**Tip:** Try to get more cars that are pretty new. They'll probably sell for a better price.

**Mileage Makes a Difference**
**Lower Mileage, Higher Price:** Cars with lower mileage (less used) usually sell for more. 
**Tip:** Cars that haven't been driven much can be a good bet. People might pay more for them.

**The Brand of the Car Matters** 
**Some Brands are More Popular:** Cars from well-known brands or fancy brands can sell for more.
**Big Range in Some Brands:** Some brands, like Ford and Chevy, have cheap and expensive cars. 
**Tip:** Get a mix of well-known and fancy brands. This way, you've got something for everyone.
